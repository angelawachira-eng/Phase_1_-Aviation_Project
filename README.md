AVIATION ANALYSIS PROJECT:STRATEGIC RISK ASSESSMENT FOR AVIATION ASSET ACQUISITION

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Aircraft operations businesses both commercial and private involve complex activities from manufacturing to flight,focusing on safety,efficiency and profitability, encompassing airline services, airport management, air traffic control and support like maintenance and logistics, all driven by strategic planning, revenue management and strict regulations. This project provides a data-driven roadmap for the company’s expansion into the aviation sector. By analyzing 61 years of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident data, this research identifies high-reliability aircraft makes and models that represent the lowest risk for commercial and private operations. Our findings bridge the gap between historical safety records and future investment strategies.

BUSINESS PROBLEM

Risk is any event leading to loss. The aviation industry too is a venture with very many risks.Entering the aviation industry involves significant capital expenditure and high liability.Without historical expertise, the company faces the "Blind Entry" risk—purchasing aircraft that may be prone to mechanical failure or high fatality rates.In the Aviation venture, risk can be categorized in terms of Severity, Structure and Mechanical aspects among others. Severity looks at the percentage of incidents that result in fatal or serious injuries. A high-risk aircraft is one where incidents are rarely survivable. Structural damage risk is the likelihood of an aircraft to being "Destroyed" vs. sustaining "Substantial" or "Minor" damage. This impacts the financial risk and insurance costs for the company.Mechanical risk is the failure rate of specific engine types across different phases of flight. With other present risks, solving the above mentioned ones will immensely boost portfolio growth,strategic agility, revenue and overall great company performance.

OBJECTIVES

The main goal and objective of this project is to identify the safest aircraft profiles, with the lowest risks,for both commercial and private operations. Looking at different factors to come up with a solid conclusion on which aircrafts to purchase, I will need to answer the following questions;

Which combination of Make, Model, Engine Type, and Aircraft Category offers the highest level of occupant safety and the lowest risk of total loss?
Which aircraft categories have the most and least frequent accidents?
Which aircraft categories provide the highest chance of survival in the event of an accident?
Which Engine types provide the most reliable performance?

DATA UNDERSTANDING

The data used in this project is a csv file named Aviation_Data, from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. It contains 90348 rows and 31 columns.

FEATURE ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS¶

Feature Engineering is a process that I have used to better represent which aircrafts have lesser risks, by creating new insightful columns. I have added new columns like Total Occupants, Total Injuries and surival rate columns to better my analysis, on which planes have Highest surival rates and lowest financial risks.

ANALYSIS AND VISUALS

My analysis is based on my objectives. In order to come up with concrete conclusions and recommendations.

CONCLUSION

First and foremost,my top 3 makes that I would recommend for purchase are BOEING,CESSNA and HUGHES. These 3 Makes have proven low financial risk exposure and high survival rates. They are also mature in terms of operations since they have been utilized over long periods and they are still highly utilized recently. My analysis demonstrates that aircraft safety is best assessed through performance consistency rather than accident frequency. High-volume aircraft manufacturers appear more frequently in accident records due to widespread usage, yet several of their models consistently deliver exceptionally high occupant survival rates and low probabilities of total structural loss.

Most importantly, the analysis identifies three aircraft Make–Model combinations that emerge as the strongest purchase candidates. These aircraft rank highest when jointly optimizing,occupant survivability,low fatality exposure and low likelihood of being destroyed.

These top 3 aircrafts are not selected because they are rare or incident-free, but because they demonstrate repeatable, long-term safety performance across hundreds of documented events. This makes them particularly suitable for organizations entering aviation operations without prior fleet experience, as they offer lower uncertainty, predictable risk profiles, and reduced exposure to catastrophic loss. My analysis also proves that aircraft category and engine types are important factors too consider to when making your decison in which aircrafts to purchase, while venturing into this new business.

RECOMMENDATIONS

ASSET ACQUISITION

Acquire Boeing or Cessna aircrafts that fall within aircraft categories with the highest average survival rates and low total risks, as identified in the analysis. Having planes with lower levels of risk will help maximize revenue in the business, and they have long-term asset value preservation. Acquiring these planes will balance safety, operational efficiency, and financial resilience, ensuring that fleet investments align with both risk mitigation objectives and sustainable revenue growth.

CONSIDER ENGINE TYPES WITH PROVEN RELIABILITY AND SURVIVAL OUTCOMES

Turbo fans, Turbo jets and Turbo props are the types of engines that have guaranteed higher levels of survival as compared to other engines. I therefore highly recommend aircrafts with these types of engines, when considering which aircrafts to purchase. Mechanical designs directly affect accident outcomes. Engines with consistent safety performance reduce the likelihood of severe accidents across different phases of flight. Considering these engines will have a value to your business in that there will be lower mechanical failure risk,reduced maintenance-related downtime and improved long-term operational reliability.

AIRCRAFT CATEGORY

In my analysis, Balloon, Airplane and Helicopter consistently emerge as the strongest categories, and each serve very different operational needs, considering the business wants to venture in both commercial and personal aviation. First, Balloons, which can fall under personal use,are ideal for low-risk personal or tourism-focused operations where safety, simplicity, and low capital exposure are priorities. Airplanes as number two best categories,is an overall best choice for both personal and commercial use. They have strong survival rates across decades. Having this type of aircraft category will bring a steady source of income as they are widely used for transportation. It is efficient for generation of revenue and portfolio growth. Fixed-wing airplanes represent the most versatile and scalable investment, offering the best balance of safety, operational range, and financial viability. Helicopters as number 3, are best for specialized commercial and emergency operations.Helicopters offer capabilities that fixed-wing aircraft simply cannot provide, making them high-value assets when used for the right missions. While they are not general-purpose aircraft, they deliver strong strategic returns in specialized business operations.3 major advantages to the business are that helicopters have reduced infrastructure costs,faster deployment to hard-to-reach locations and increased operational flexibility.
